# Deep Learning Model
Humans can easily identify if a person is a female or a male with high accuracy, and also roughly tell his/her age. Now given a large labelled training dataset,
the computer can also do the gender classification and age estimation.

2 CNN models will be trained for age estimation and gender classification on given dataset.
